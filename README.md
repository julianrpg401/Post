# Post

* Post is a social network focused on debate and the dissemination of ideas, where users can freely expose their options on various topics through the use of hashtags. The popularity of a post will work through a voting system (similar to reactions) where users will be able to vote for "relevant" or "irrelevant".

## Database Scheme

* To create the database, execute the script found in the [script folder](Post.Backend.API/script).
